# Data Quality & Observability Intelligence Platform

When something goes wrong with your data — a sudden spike in missing values, an unexpected drop in row counts, a column that has drifted to the wrong format — the usual response is a frantic search across dashboards, log files, Slack threads, and runbooks. This platform replaces that scramble with an AI team that does the investigation automatically, in under two minutes, and hands you a written diagnosis and a step-by-step fix.

Seven specialised AI agents collaborate in a structured pipeline. Each agent focuses on one part of the problem — checking the data rules, detecting the anomaly, finding the root cause, mapping downstream damage, assessing business risk, and drafting the remediation plan. They share findings with each other, look up relevant history from a knowledge base, and call real data-quality tools along the way. A human stays in control: the plan is always presented for review before anything is changed in production.

---

## Who is this for?

| Role | How it helps |
|---|---|
| **Data engineers** | Get a written root-cause report and a concrete fix plan instead of starting blind from a monitoring alert |
| **Analytics engineers** | Understand which downstream models and dashboards are at risk before a broken table reaches a stakeholder |
| **Data team leads** | See the business impact — SLA breach risk, financial exposure, escalation contacts — in the same report as the technical diagnosis |
| **Platform / MLOps teams** | Use the REST API to integrate automated triage into an existing alert pipeline (PagerDuty, Airflow, dbt Cloud, etc.) |
| **AI / LLM engineers** | A reference implementation of a production-quality multi-agent system: LangGraph orchestration, RAG-augmented agents, MCP tool servers, two-layer memory, and tiered Claude model usage |

---

## What it does, in plain language

### Catches and confirms the problem
When an alert fires — a null-value spike, a volume drop, a schema change — the platform first re-checks the data against your defined quality rules using Great Expectations. This separates a genuine problem from a noisy alert before spending any AI budget on it.

### Finds the root cause
A reasoning agent (Claude Opus) reads the validation results alongside 48 hours of historical anomaly data and a library of past incidents. It produces a written root-cause explanation with a confidence score — the same kind of analysis a senior data engineer would write, but in seconds rather than hours.

### Maps the blast radius
A lineage agent traces which upstream pipelines fed the broken table and which downstream tables, reports, and consumers depend on it. You see the full impact radius before deciding how urgently to act.

### Tells you what it means for the business
A business-impact agent translates the technical findings into stakeholder language: which SLAs are at risk of breach, an estimated financial exposure, which teams need to be looped in, and who the on-call escalation contact is.

### Proposes a safe fix
A remediation agent matches the situation against your playbook library, generates a step-by-step repair plan, and runs it in dry-run mode first. The plan is presented for human approval; it is only applied automatically if you explicitly enable auto-remediation and the risk level is rated `low`.

### Gets smarter over time
Every decision the agents make is stored in a local SQLite database. When you mark an investigation as resolved (or not), that outcome is attached to all the agent decisions in that run. Future investigations on similar anomalies retrieve those historical outcomes from the knowledge base and use them to improve their analysis — a lightweight feedback loop that compounds over time.

---

## Possible use cases

**Automated alert triage in a data platform**
Point your monitoring tool (Monte Carlo, Great Expectations Cloud, dbt tests, custom Airflow sensors) at the REST API. When an alert fires, `POST /api/v1/investigations` to kick off an investigation automatically. By the time an engineer looks at the PagerDuty page, the root cause and remediation plan are already written.

**Pre-deployment data validation gate**
Run an investigation against a staging dataset before a pipeline promotion. If the validation or detection agents flag a problem, the deployment is blocked and a written explanation is returned to the CI job.

**Incident retrospective generation**
After a data incident is resolved, retrieve the full investigation state via the API and use it as the raw material for a post-mortem. All agent findings, confidence scores, and latencies are structured JSON — easy to feed into a report template.

**SLA monitoring with impact scoring**
Use the business-impact agent's output to triage incidents by revenue risk rather than alert severity. A low-confidence anomaly in a high-revenue table may deserve faster escalation than a high-confidence anomaly in a cold-path table.

**Knowledge base for on-call engineers**
The three knowledge-base tabs (anomaly patterns, DQ rules, remediation playbooks, business context) can be queried directly via the UI or API without running a full investigation. Useful for looking up "what did we do last time this happened?" during an incident.

**Reference architecture for multi-agent AI systems**
The codebase demonstrates several patterns that are difficult to find in a single working example: severity-gated conditional routing in LangGraph, per-agent RAG context enrichment, Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool servers, tiered LLM usage (Opus for reasoning, Sonnet for structured output, Haiku for fast tasks), session checkpointing, and a two-level mock testing strategy that runs without any external services.

```

**Key design principles:**
- **Severity-gated routing** — Diagnosis only runs when an anomaly is detected; Remediation only runs for `critical`/`high` severity, so low-signal alerts don't waste compute or API budget
- **RAG-augmented agents** — every agent retrieves relevant historical anomalies, playbooks, and business rules from the knowledge base before calling the LLM, keeping prompts grounded in your data's actual history
- **Two-layer memory** — LangGraph session checkpoints store the in-flight workflow state; a SQLite decision log stores every agent judgment with feedback, enabling long-term learning across investigations
- **Single-call MCP tools** — agents call Great Expectations, Monte Carlo, and custom lineage/remediation tools via the Model Context Protocol; each call returns a complete result with no polling loops

## Download all wheels (optional, speeds up builds)

Pre-downloading wheels avoids re-fetching large packages (torch ~700 MB) on every build.
The main `Dockerfile` uses `--find-links ./wheels` so it uses local wheels when present and
falls back to the internet for anything missing.

```bash
pip download --dest docker-wheels/ \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
    torch==2.10.0 sentence-transformers==5.2.3 \
    langgraph==0.2.55 langchain-core==0.3.83 langchain==0.3.27 \
    langchain-anthropic==0.3.4 langchain-chroma==0.2.6 \
    langchain-community==0.3.31 \
    llama-index-core==0.14.15 llama-index-embeddings-huggingface==0.6.1 \
    chromadb==1.5.2 rank-bm25==0.2.2 fastmcp==3.1.0 \
    fastapi==0.135.1 "uvicorn[standard]==0.41.0" httpx==0.28.1 \
    pydantic==2.12.5 tenacity==9.1.4 python-dotenv==1.2.2 \
    langgraph-checkpoint==2.1.2 langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite==2.0.11
```

To upgrade a package, change its version in `.env` and re-run the command above with the new version, then `make build`.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AI-assisted-data-quality
make quickstart
```

`make quickstart` will:
1. Create `.env` from `.env.example` (and stop if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is still the placeholder)
2. Build all 6 Docker images
3. Start the full stack (`docker compose up -d`)
4. Wait 45 s for healthchecks to pass
5. Seed all 4 Chroma knowledge-base collections

Then open **http://localhost:3000**.

**Manual equivalent** (if you prefer explicit steps):

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
sleep 45
docker compose exec app python scripts/seed_demo_data.py
```

## Demo Walkthrough

### The Canonical Scenario: "Null Spike Investigation"

This 5-minute flow exercises all 7 agents, 3 MCP servers, RAG retrieval, and the memory system.

#### Step 1 — Trigger the investigation

Open http://localhost:3000, go to **Tab 1 "Run Investigation"**, and fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Dataset ID | `orders_2026_03` |
| Table Name | `orders` |
| Alert Type | `null_spike` |
| Description | `Noticed customer_id column has unusually high null rate this morning` |

Click **▶ Run Investigation**. The UI displays the investigation ID and starts polling every 2 seconds.

#### Step 2 — Phase 1: Detection (automatic)

- **Validation Agent** (Claude Haiku 4.5) calls the GX MCP server: creates an expectation suite, runs a checkpoint, and retrieves results. Finds 5% null rate in `customer_id` (500 / 10,000 rows) — a clear `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null` failure.
- **Detection Agent** (Claude Haiku 4.5) calls the Monte Carlo mock for table health + recent anomalies. Queries the `anomaly_patterns` RAG collection and surfaces `DQ-2026-0001` (a similar historical null spike, resolved in 2.5h). Emits `anomaly_detected=True, confidence=0.91`.

Phase progress updates live in the UI. After Detection, `current_phase=detection_complete, severity=high`.

#### Step 3 — Phase 2: Diagnosis (automatic)

The Orchestrator routes to the Diagnosis pipeline because an anomaly was detected.

- **Diagnosis Agent** (Claude Opus 4.6) synthesizes GX failures, Monte Carlo anomalies, and the RAG-retrieved historical case. Determines `root_cause="Upstream API deployment returning null customer_id values"`, `confidence=0.87`.
- **Lineage Agent** (Claude Haiku 4.5) calls `analyze_data_lineage(orders, depth=3)`. Finds 4 downstream consumers (`revenue_report`, `customer_segment_model`, `marketing_pipeline`, `finance_dashboard`), `impact_radius=7`, `critical_path_breached=True`.

After Lineage, `current_phase=diagnosis_complete, severity=high`.

#### Step 4 — Phase 3: Remediation (automatic)

The Orchestrator routes to Remediation because `severity=high`.

- **Business Impact Agent** (Claude Opus 4.6) calls `assess_business_impact`. Determines `escalation_required=True`, with `revenue_report` approaching its 2h SLA.
- **Repair Agent** (Claude Haiku 4.5) retrieves playbook `PB-ROLLBACK-001` from RAG, calls `get_similar_anomalies` to find `DQ-2026-0001`'s resolution, then calls `apply_remediation(dry_run=True)`. Produces a 6-step rollback + backfill plan.

Final state: `current_phase=remediation_complete`.

#### Step 5 — Read the results

The UI displays:
- 🟠 **HIGH** severity badge
- Root cause with 87% confidence
- ~500 affected records
- Downstream impact: 7 nodes including `revenue_report` (SLA risk)
- Historical match: `DQ-2026-0001` — resolved in 2.5h by rollback
- Remediation plan: dry-run confirmed safe, 90-min estimated duration
- Escalation contacts

Per-agent latencies are shown as a bar chart.

#### Step 6 — Submit feedback (closes the learning loop)

Go to **Tab 2 "History"**, find the investigation, click **✅ Mark Resolved**. This records `was_correct=True` in `decisions.db` for all agent decisions in this investigation. The next similar investigation will retrieve this outcome from long-term memory to improve its recommendations.

---

## Demonstrating Individual Features

### RAG Knowledge Base (Tab 3)

Search across any of the 4 Chroma collections without running a full investigation:

| Collection | What it contains | Example query |
|---|---|---|
| `anomaly_patterns` | 20 historical anomaly records with root causes and resolutions | `null spike customer_id` |
| `dq_rules` | Data quality rules per table and expectation type | `orders completeness rules` |
| `remediation_playbooks` | 10 step-by-step fix procedures (rollback, backfill, quarantine…) | `how to rollback pipeline` |
| `business_context` | SLA, criticality, and ownership metadata per table | `revenue_report sla` |

Results are ranked by a BM25 + vector ensemble retriever with cross-encoder reranking (MiniLM-L-6-v2).

### REST API (direct curl)

```bash
# Trigger an investigation
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/investigations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dataset_id":"orders_2026_03","table_name":"orders",
       "alert_type":"null_spike",
       "description":"High null rate in customer_id"}'

# Poll state (replace ID)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/investigations/<id> | python3 -m json.tool

# Submit feedback
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/investigations/<id>/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"was_resolved":true,"resolution_notes":"Rolled back API v2.3.1"}'

# Query knowledge base
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rag/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"null spike orders table","collection":"anomaly_patterns","limit":3}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Graceful degradation

Stop a single MCP server mid-demo — the investigation continues with fallback results and no 500 errors:

```bash
docker compose stop mcp-gx

# Trigger an investigation — validation degrades gracefully, detection continues
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/investigations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dataset_id":"orders_2026_03","table_name":"orders",
       "alert_type":"null_spike","description":"Test degraded mode"}'

# Health reflects the outage
curl http://localhost:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool
# "mcp_gx": "degraded", "status": "degraded"

docker compose start mcp-gx  # restore
```

### Long-term memory persistence

After running at least one investigation and submitting feedback:

```bash
docker compose exec app python3 -c "
import sqlite3, os
conn = sqlite3.connect(os.getenv('DECISIONS_DB_PATH', '/data/sqlite/decisions.db'))
rows = conn.execute('''
    SELECT agent_name, decision_type, confidence, was_correct
    FROM agent_decisions LIMIT 10
''').fetchall()
for r in rows:
    print(r)
conn.close()
"
```

### Verify all services and collections

```bash
# Health
curl http://localhost:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool

# Chroma collection counts
docker compose exec app python3 -c "
import chromadb
c = chromadb.HttpClient(host='chroma', port=8000)
for col in ['anomaly_patterns','dq_rules','remediation_playbooks','business_context']:
    print(f'{col}: {c.get_collection(col).count()} docs')
"

# MCP server health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
curl http://localhost:8082/health
curl http://localhost:8083/health
```

---

## Testing

Tests run entirely locally — no Docker required. A mock Anthropic server (started automatically by the test suite) handles all LLM calls, so no real API key is needed.

```bash
make test               # all 86 tests (unit + integration)
make test-unit          # 71 unit tests — agent nodes, routing, MCP session logic
make test-integration   # 15 integration tests — full HTTP API layer
make lint               # ruff lint + format check
```

On first run `make test` creates a `.venv`, installs `requirements.txt` + `requirements-dev.txt`, then runs pytest. Subsequent runs skip the install step unless either requirements file has changed.

**What is tested:**

| Suite | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py` | `terminal_node`, `route_from_orchestrator` (all branches), `safe_agent_node` latency/error tracking, MCP session caching, SSE parsing |
| `tests/unit/test_validation_node.py` | Happy path, 3 MCP tool calls, RAG retrieval, LLM fallback, resilience to each dependency failing |
| `tests/unit/test_detection_node.py` | Severity mapping for all 5 alert types, `anomaly_detected=False` → `severity=None`, resilience |
| `tests/unit/test_diagnosis_node.py` | 48 h Monte Carlo lookback, RAG similar-anomaly + playbook queries, fallback |
| `tests/unit/test_lineage_node.py` | `current_phase` transition, severity propagation from `diagnosis_result`, resilience |
| `tests/unit/test_business_impact_node.py` | Fallback escalation logic for critical/high severity, resilience |
| `tests/unit/test_repair_node.py` | Dry-run default, `auto_remediate + risk_level=low` → live run, medium-risk stays dry |
| `tests/integration/test_investigation_api.py` | All REST endpoints: POST/GET investigations, feedback, RAG query/index, health |

**Mock strategy:** unit tests patch `invoke_with_retry`, `call_mcp_tool`, `get_retriever`, and `get_long_term_memory` at each agent module. Integration tests use a lightweight test FastAPI app with mocked `app.state`, backed by a real in-process mock Anthropic server on port 19876.

---

## Shutdown

```bash
make down       # stop and remove all containers (data in ./data/ is preserved)
make stop       # pause containers — resume later with: make up
make clean      # remove containers AND delete ./data/chroma/ and ./data/sqlite/
```

Use `make clean` when you want a completely fresh start (equivalent to `make reset` but without the automatic restart and re-seed).

---

## Reset to Clean State

To wipe all data and restart with a freshly seeded knowledge base in one step:

```bash
make reset
```

This is equivalent to running `bash scripts/reset_demo.sh`: stops all containers, clears `data/chroma/` and `data/sqlite/`, restarts services, waits 45 seconds for healthchecks, then re-seeds all 4 Chroma collections automatically.

---
